# EventBus

## Overview

EventBus is a scalable, real-time, high-throughput, low-latency event routing and processing infrastructure designed for modern distributed systems. It enables efficient communication and event handling across components or services, ensuring timely and reliable delivery of events in a highly performant manner.

## Features

- Highly scalable design to handle large volumes of events.
- Real-time event routing with minimal latency.
- High throughput for processing numerous events per second.
- Low-latency communication across distributed system components.
- Built using Rust for safety and performance.
- Suitable for modern microservices and distributed architectures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust programming language environment (version X.X or higher recommended).
- Familiarity with event-driven architectures and distributed systems.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/foxy1081/EventBus.git
cd EventBus
```

Build the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be provided here once available. Typically, EventBus can be integrated into your Rust-based distributed system project to manage event routing and processing.

Example usage might include:

- Defining event types.
- Subscribing to event topics.
- Publishing events to the bus.
- Handling event delivery and retries.
